A collection of projects to better understand quant finance. Often built in conjunction with books I am reading. I often write code in Jupyter notebooks. Unfortunately, Github often doesn't display the notebooks on Github. As a result, if you would like to view the notebooks, I recommend pasting the link from the file into https://nbviewer.org/.
